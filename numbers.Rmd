```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Doing some fund R stuff in here.

```{r data}
library(tidyverse)

dat<-data.frame(A=c(1,2,3,9,8,7,6,5,4,0),
                B=c(1,5,9,4,12,7,5,6,4,1)) %>%
  mutate(C=B*A)

dat

# OK trying to add something?

ah_plot <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = A, y = B)) +
  geom_point(color = "black")

```

And then some random text...
